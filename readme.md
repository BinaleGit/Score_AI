# Student Study Hours Predictor

This web application uses machine learning to predict and learn about the relationship between the amount of hours students study and the scores they achieve. It utilizes a CSV file to store and update data.

## Features

- **Predict:** Users can input the number of study hours, and the application predicts the expected score based on the machine learning model trained on existing data.
- **Learn:** Users can provide new data (hours studied and actual scores), which updates the CSV file and re-trains the machine learning model for more accurate predictions.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Place your CSV file containing study hours and scores data in the project directory with the name `music.csv`.
4. Run the Flask application using `python app.py`.
5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000/`.

## Usage

1. **Home:** Visit the home page (`http://localhost:5000/`) for an overview of the application.
2. **Predict:** Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/predict` to predict scores based on study hours. Enter the number of study hours and submit the form to see the predicted score.
3. **Learn:** Go to `http://localhost:5000/learn` to provide new data. Enter the study hours and the actual score achieved. This data will be added to the CSV file, and the machine learning model will be retrained for improved predictions.

## File Structure

- `app.py`: Contains the Flask application code with routes for prediction and learning.
- `music.csv`: CSV file storing study hours and scores data.
- `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates for rendering pages.
- `static/`: Directory for static files like CSS and JavaScript (if needed).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- scikit-learn (for machine learning)

## Note

- Ensure that the CSV file follows the required format with columns for hours studied and scores achieved.
- This application serves as a simple example and may require additional enhancements for production use, such as input validation, error handling, and security measures.
